Description/Requirements:  We are going to write a program that
trains a perceptron on one data set and then tests it on a second data set.
The data files must be formated as follows:  

<number of lines>
<number of columns>
<row 1>
<row 2>
etc....

The first number in each line IS the outcome we are trying to predict. 
So a row would like like this

outcome, data 1, data 2, data 3....data n


STORM:
 perceptron
  members: 
  -an array of weights ( cols - 1 ) 
  -howmany weights
  -threshold
  -learn rate ( larger values mean bigger changes )
  methods:
  -classify a row
  -update ( in case it is wrong )
  -init ( CONSTRUCTOR )
  -print the weights and threshold
  
 data set
  members:
   -an array of row objects
   -how many rows
   -how many cols
  methods:
   -return a pointer to a row
   -read from a file ( CONSTRUCTOR )
   
 
 row object
  members:
   -howmany cols
   -the data ( cols -1 in size )
   -outcome 
  methods:
   -read itself a file ( CONSTRUCTOR )
   -return a col
   -return the outcome
 driver object
  members:
   -training data set
   -testing data set
   -perceptron
  methods:
   -read from two files ( CONSTRUCTOR )
   -train
   -test
